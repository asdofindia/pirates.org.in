				<h2>Why Indian Pirates?<br>
				</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>No one asked us how we think this world should be. We should no longer
							accept what we supposedly cannot change. Instead, 
							we need to change what we cannot accept.</li>
				<li>So we are remaking this world the way we think it should be</li>
				<li>Based on equality, democracy and transparency</li>

				<h3>Article 1: Basic Principles</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Section 1: We understand individuals and families of all sections of the society and different geographic locations have a right to realize equal life chances regardless of identity. Economic inequity, caste or gender or sexuality based discrimination, and differential abilities prevent many from realizing the equity of opportunities.</li>

				<h3>Article 1: Basic Principles</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Section 4: Knowledge should be free</li>
						<li>Section 5: We promote transparent government</li>
						<li>Section 6: We are opposed to the use of violence to achieve 
																political aims. We will not, in any manner, promote or instigate or 
																participate in violence. AND WE MEAN IT. However, we see violence as 
																distinct from the issue it supports or opposes. The violence must be 
																prosecuted through prevailing laws, and the issue must be evaluated 
																through debate on its own merit.</li>
					</ul>

    <h3>The Pirate Label</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The “pirate” label, which had been used by the media and film industries in campaigns against copyright infringement, is a reappropriation of the word.</li>
        <li>In sociology and cultural studies, reappropriation is the cultural process by which a group reclaims—re-appropriates—terms or artifacts that were previously used in a way disparaging of that group.</li>
